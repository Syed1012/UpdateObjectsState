# React + Vite

- ButnuseState.jsx is a practise file

- spread operator [ ... ] ‚≠ê It is used to change the value of a particular object, without changing all the object values again. for eg. checkout MyComponent.jsx file

- we will use updater function which is a good practise as we dont wanna give new input and what we are doing is we are trying to update the previous value. & since we are working on previous state of object not the current state we are using c in place of complete car
